# MicroMouse

[Micromouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse) is basically a robot game to solve a 16x16 maze. It takes two runs: (1) first run is to find the best route inside the unknown maze, and (2) second run is to perform the best route.

In this project, we only implement Micromouse in Javascript which are preferable for algorithm development only. We also pre-loaded several mazes and randomly choose at the intital phases.
